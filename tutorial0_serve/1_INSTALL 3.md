# Installations

The first step is to install all the appropriate software to get our environment together. Please install the following on the computer you intend to complete all the tutorials from. 

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) version control software. You will also need an account on [Github.com](https://github.com/).
    - all installation details are included in the [Getting Started Installing Git link](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). 
    - if you have a mac, and you have installed Xcode, you _already have git_. You can test this by opening your terminal and running `git --version`.
    - if you are using a PC, an application called "git bash" will be part of the default git install. You should use this application every time we reference "terminal", rather than the "command prompt".
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - javascript development software. You can check if the install was succesful by running `node -v` in your git bash (PC) or terminal (Mac). It should return your version number. 
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - free code editor and IDE (our recommendation). This is an application to view files and code. This application also includes a local server extension, as outlined in [BASIC_SERVER](./3_BASIC_SERVER.md).
